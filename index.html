    <h1>SPM.1: Figure 1 of the Summary for Policymakers of the IPCC’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C</h1>

    <p id='para_above_plot1'>The IPCC Special Report on 1.5℃, released in December 2018, presents the most up-to-date research on the science around the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to pursue efforts to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 1.5℃ above pre-industrial levels.</p>

    <p id='para_above_plot2'>Here we present an interactive version of figure SPM.1 in the Summary for Policymakers to help users understand how cumulative emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> and other climate drivers determine the probability of limiting warming to 1.5℃.
